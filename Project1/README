Make sure the makefile!!!!!!!!




README.txt

1. Brief description.

These are the code of Programming Assignment 1.
Client.cc is the source file of client. 
Server.cc is the source file of server. Both of them include the header file util.h, which provides utility functions and classes.

The Makefile is modified in order to gcc 4.6.3 to compile. If compiling with higher version of gcc, it requires changes to the Makefile.

2. Development environment.

Programming Language: c++11
OS: OS X version 10.11 
Compiler: clang+LLVM 7.0.0 (-std=c++11)
Compatible with (according to the CLIC machine):
OS: Ubuntu 14.04LTS
Compiler: GNU GCC 4.6.4 (-std=c++0x)


If you are using GCC version higher than 4.7, you should change the (-std=c++0x) to (-std=c++11) in Makefile. Thank you!

3. Instructions to Run

Use $make to compile all the source files.

If you want to clean the compiled output, 
use $make clean

Use $./Server <port number>
to run the server.

Use $./Client <server_ip> <server_port>
to run the client.

Use preset username and password to login.
After login you can type in your command after
>>>
(sometimes the >>> may disapear, but it will not influence your inputing)

Use
>>>logout
to logout. (Please do not use Ctrl + C, or it will crash the server. Sorry for not implementing the graceful exit in such way)

4. Sample Commands.

>>>whoelse
Display the names of online users.

>>>wholast 5
Display the names of previous online users within 5 minutes.

>>>broadcast message Hello
Braodcast "Hello" to everyone.

>>>broadcast user columbia foobar message Hello folks
Broadcast "Hello folks" to comlumbia and foobar

>>>message columbia how are you
Message columbia with "how are you"

5. additional functionalities

a. Offline private message
 When user sends private message, if the receiver is offline, the message will be stored and show to the receiver upon receiver logging in. 

It is the same to send such offline message as the normal privagte message.
>>>message columbia call me back

To test such function, you can login and send message to another offiline user and login the receiver later to see the offlien messages.

b. Blacklist
 If a user does not want to receive information from a specific user, he can enlist the user on the blacklist. He can also remove the user from the black list, namely, unblock the user.
 When a user is under your blacklist, he cannot send you private message as well as broad cast message.

 To enlist a user into blacklist
 >>>block columbia
 (block <username>)

 To unenlist a user from blacklist
 >>>unblock columbia
 (unblock <username>)

To test such function, you can let two users message/broadcast each other and enlist/unenlist other users.
